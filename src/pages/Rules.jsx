      <h2>Rules and Qualifications</h2>

      <p>
        We adhere to a specific set of rules and qualifications that must be
        followed across all batches.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Walker Archives hosts plotting-based agencies, exclusively
            accommodating <b>MVRP</b> and <b>OCRP</b> accounts. Individuals
            interested in developing their Original Character or creating one
            tailored to suit a particular batch's concept are welcome.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            At Walker Archives, we accommodate faceclaims and writers from
            diverse nationalities. During the agency's operational periods, we
            require joiners to communicate exclusively in <b>English</b>.
            Exceptions may arise in necessary situations, such as posting
            faceclaim updates in languages like Korean, Thai, or any other
            languages, as well as tasks that specifically require the use of
            different languages.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We only accept faceclaims and writers who are 18 years of age or
            older.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We do not accommodate duplicate faceclaims. However, we encourage
            the submission of an alternative faceclaim in the registration form.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            An account is prohibited from joining two consecutive batches.
            Instead, an account is permitted to participate once every other
            batch. This is a new rule, and will take effect in batch 7.
            Therefore, batch 7 joiners cannot join batch 8.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Acceptance is primarily determined by the answers provided in the
            forms, and therefore, an account's prior activity does not influence
            the decision. However, upon acceptance, joiners are expected to
            maintain consistent activity throughout the agency's duration.
            Inactivity will be considered when applying for subsequent batches.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We do not allow taking hiatus or temporary hiatus during the
            agency's period. As our agency runs within a storyline, a joiner's
            absence could impact the narrative flow. Additionally, departures
            are not permitted. If an individual is unable to continue, their
            account will not be removed for the sake of maintaining the
            storyline.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Registering double accounts is{" "}
            <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>
              strictly prohibited.
            </span>
            If found in violation of this rule, you will be banned from
            participating in any of Walker Archives' agencies.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            An account is permitted to join a maximum of two agencies at the
            same time, including one from Walker Archives while it is running.
            For instance, it is allowed to join Agency 1 and a Walker Archives
            Agency simultaneously. However, participating in Agency 1, Agency 2,
            and a Walker Archives Agency simultaneously is not permitted. Squads
            are excluded from this count.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Last, but not the least: respect everyone. Any form of hateful or
            disrespectful comments, especially those below the belt, will not be
            tolerated.
          </li>
        </ol>
